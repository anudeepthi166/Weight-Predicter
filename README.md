# Weight-Predicter
This code will helps you to predict the weight of person in pounds when the height is given in inches,
For this this model is developed by using Neural Network by creating neurons

In this neurons we have used "linear" as activation function
And we have trained this model 5 times  by using the given data ,this can be done using epochs
